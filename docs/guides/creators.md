# Third Room for Creators

This guide is designed to help you understand how to create, export, and upload your 3D content for use in Third Room worlds. With Third Room, you have the opportunity to bring your artistic vision to life in a virtual environment that promotes collaboration and communication.

## Creating 3D Content

As a creative, you can use any 3D modeling or design software that supports exporting in the glTF format. This format is widely supported by many popular tools, including Blender, Autodesk Maya, 3ds Max, SketchUp, and Unity3D, among others. glTF is a versatile and efficient format for rendering 3D models and scenes in real-time applications, making it ideal for use in Third Room worlds.

### 1. Choose your 3D modeling software

For Unity3D users, Third Room offers an [official pipeline]() for importing assets created in Unity3D, making it even easier for you to create assets for Third Room. However, you can select any 3D modeling or design software that suits your skill level, preferences, and supports the glTF format.

There is also an in-world editor accessible via tilde (`) that is in its early stages but will be continuously updated.

### 2. Create your 3D content

Using your chosen software, create your 3D models, scenes, or assets. This could include anything from characters and objects to entire environments. Be sure to consider the performance and optimization of your 3D content, as complex models may impact the user experience within Third Room.

## Exporting and Uploading 3D Content

Once you have created your 3D content, you'll need to export it in the glTF format and upload it to Third Room.

### 1. Export your 3D content in the glTF format

Each 3D modeling software has its own method for exporting models in the glTF format. Consult the documentation or help resources for your specific software to learn the export process. Ensure that your 3D content is correctly exported with all necessary textures, animations, and other associated files.

For Unity3D users, follow the guidelines provided by Third Room for the asset import pipeline to ensure a seamless integration of your Unity3D assets into Third Room worlds.
