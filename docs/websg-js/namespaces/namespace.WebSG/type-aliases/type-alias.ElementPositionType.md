# ElementPositionType

**`Type alias`**

> **ElementPositionType**: "relative" \| "absolute"

A type representing the possible values for the position property of a UIElement.

- "relative": The element is positioned relative to its normal position, without affecting the position of other elements.
- "absolute": The element is positioned relative to its nearest positioned ancestor (or the container if no positioned ancestor exists), and other elements are positioned as if the absolute element doesn't exist.
